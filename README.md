# Hand Gesture Recognition

This repository contains code and resources for a hand gesture recognition project using the Hand Gesture Recognition Database from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/gti-upm/leapgestrecog).

## Dataset

The dataset consists of hand gesture images captured using the Leap Motion Controller. It includes images for various hand gestures such as palm, fist, peace sign, and more. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify these hand gestures.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages.
3. Open the `main.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Follow the instructions and code in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
